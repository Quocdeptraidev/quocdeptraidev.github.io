## Cost Impact

### Security and Network-Related Costs
- **AWS Transit Gateway**: Costs are based on the number of attachments and the amount of data processed.
- **VPC Flow Logs & CloudWatch**: Costs are incurred per GB of data ingested and stored.
- **NAT Gateway**: Billed per hour and per GB of data processed.
- **Data Transfer**: Costs may apply for data transferred between Availability Zones.

### Cost Optimization
1.  **Estimate Costs:** Use the **[AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/)**.
2.  **Optimize Logging:** Filter flow logs and set retention policies.
3.  **Commit to Usage:** Use **Savings Plans** or **Reserved Instances**.
4.  **Monitor Costs:** Use **AWS Cost Explorer** and **AWS Budgets**.

## Automation with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

In practice, use tools like **AWS CloudFormation** or **Terraform** to automate deployment, ensure consistency, and minimize errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Security Issues
1.  **Cannot connect between VPCs:** Check TGW route tables, Security Groups, and NACLs.
2.  **Internet access is not working:** Check the default route, NAT Gateway, and Security Group outbound rules.
3.  **Flow logs are not appearing:** Check IAM permissions and log group configurations.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we will:
1.  Implement comprehensive testing procedures.
2.  Set up monitoring dashboards.
3.  Perform performance optimizations.
4.  Create operational runbooks.
