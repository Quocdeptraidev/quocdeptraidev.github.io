# Chapter 5: Configure Routing and Security

In this chapter, we will dive deep into configuring advanced routing policies and implementing comprehensive security measures for our hub-and-spoke architecture on AWS.

Cloud network architectures, especially the hub-and-spoke model, demand a robust routing and security strategy to ensure performance, scalability, and compliance. Effective routing helps control data flow between different environments (e.g., production, development, shared services), while multi-layered security is key to protecting resources from internal and external threats. This chapter will provide an overview and detailed guidance on setting up these components, from Transit Gateway configuration to implementing protective measures like Security Groups and Network ACLs, as well as monitoring and optimization tools.

We will explore how to use AWS Transit Gateway for granular traffic control, segment environments to enhance security, and set up multiple layers of protection from Network ACLs to Security Groups. Additionally, this chapter will guide you through monitoring, logging, and best practices to ensure a secure, efficient, and resilient network infrastructure.
