# Advanced VPC Network Architecture with Transit Gateway Workshop

### Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to design and implement an advanced multi-VPC network architecture using AWS Transit Gateway in a hub-and-spoke model. The workshop will guide you through building a scalable, secure, and efficient network for an enterprise environment.

### Workshop Objectives

- **Design an enterprise-grade network architecture** with AWS Transit Gateway
- **Implement a hub-and-spoke model** to optimize connectivity
- **Configure multi-layer security** with Security Groups and NACLs
- **Optimize costs** through shared services
- **Monitor and troubleshoot** network performance

### Key Components
#### 1. Hub VPC (Central Hub)
- **Shared Services**: NAT Gateway, DNS, Active Directory
- **Security Services**: Firewall, IDS/IPS, Security monitoring
- **Management Services**: Bastion hosts, monitoring tools
- **Connectivity**: VPN Gateway, Direct Connect Gateway

#### 2. Spoke VPCs (Branches)
- **Production VPC**: Production environment with high availability
- **Development VPC**: Development and testing environment
- **Staging VPC**: Pre-production environment
- **DMZ VPC**: Demilitarized zone for public-facing services

#### 3. Transit Gateway
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic flow between VPCs
- **Attachments**: Connections to VPC, VPN, Direct Connect
- **Route Propagation**: Automatic route learning and distribution

### Workshop Content

 1. [Introduction and Architecture](1-Introduce/)
 2. [Transit Gateway Setup](2-transit-gateway/)
 3. [Hub VPC Overview](3-hub-vpc/)
 4. [Create Spoke VPCs (Production & Development)](4-spoke-vpcs/)
 5. [Configure Routing and Security](5-routing-security/)
 6. [Testing and Monitoring](6-testing-monitoring/)
 7. [Resource Cleanup](7-cleanup/)

### Architectural Benefits

#### 1. Connection Optimization
- Reduces connections from O(n²) to O(n)
- Simplified network topology
- Centralized routing control

#### 2. Enhanced Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Environment isolation
- **Centralized Security**: Apply security policies from the hub
- **Traffic Inspection**: Centralized traffic control and monitoring

#### 3. Efficient Management
- **Single Point of Control**: Manage routing from one place
- **Shared Services**: Optimize costs and resources
- **Scalability**: Easy addition/removal of spoke VPCs

#### 4. Cost Optimization
- Share NAT Gateway and common services
- Reduce data transfer costs
- Optimize bandwidth utilization

### Estimated Time
- **Total time**: 6-8 hours
- **Level**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Estimated cost**: ~$15-20 for the complete workshop

### Prerequisites

#### AWS Account
- AWS Account with admin permissions
- AWS CLI configured
- Region: Asia Pacific (Singapore) - ap-southeast-1

#### Required Knowledge
- Basic understanding of AWS VPC
- Experience with EC2 and networking
- Familiarity with the AWS Console

#### Required Tools
- AWS CLI
- SSH client
- Text editor
- Web browser

### Estimated Costs

| Service | Cost/Month | Workshop (4 days) |
|--- |--- |--- |
| Transit Gateway | $36.00 | $4.80 |
| NAT Gateway | $45.00 | $6.00 |
| VPC Endpoints | $7.20 | $0.96 |
| EC2 Instances | $7.50 | $1.00 |
| **Total** | **$95.70** | **~$12.76** |

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- The workshop will incur real AWS costs
- Monitor costs via AWS Cost Explorer
- **Cleanup is mandatory** after completion
- Do not use a production account
- Use an IAM user with minimum necessary permissions

### Expected Outcomes

After completing this workshop, you will have:

1. A complete network architecture with detailed documentation
2. A security framework ensuring multi-layered security
3. Performance benchmarks and optimization guidelines
4. A cost analysis with recommendations
5. Operational procedures for troubleshooting and DR
6. Best practices for enterprise network design
