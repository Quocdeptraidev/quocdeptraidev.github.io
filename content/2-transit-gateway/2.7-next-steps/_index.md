In the next chapter, we will:
1.  Create a Hub VPC to contain shared services.
2.  Attach the Hub VPC to the Transit Gateway.
3.  Configure a NAT Gateway and VPC Endpoints in the Hub VPC.
4.  **Enable VPC Flow Logs** to monitor network traffic (we skipped this in this chapter as we don't have a VPC yet).

Save the Transit Gateway ID â€“ you will need it for the following chapters!
