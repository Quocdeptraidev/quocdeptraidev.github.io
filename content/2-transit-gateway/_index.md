In this chapter, we will create and configure the AWS Transit Gateway â€“ the central component of our hub-and-spoke architecture.

## Transit Gateway Overview

AWS Transit Gateway is a service that enables you to connect your VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and eliminates complex peering relationships.

### Key Benefits:
- **Simplified Connectivity**: Connect multiple VPCs through a single central point.
- **Scalability**: Supports thousands of VPC attachments.
- **Centralized Routing**: Manage routing from a single place.
- **Inter-Region Peering**: Connect Transit Gateways in different AWS regions.
