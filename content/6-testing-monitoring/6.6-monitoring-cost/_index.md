## Monitoring Costs

{{% notice info %}}
Understanding and optimizing monitoring costs is crucial for effective budget management in a cloud environment. Monitoring services like CloudWatch can incur costs based on the amount of data collected, the number of alarms, and query frequency. By implementing cost optimization strategies, you can minimize expenses while maintaining essential monitoring capabilities.

### Monitoring Costs
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: ~$0.30/metric/month
- **CloudWatch Logs**: ~$0.50/GB ingested
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: ~$0.10/alarm/month
- **Lambda Functions**: ~$0.20/1M requests
- **Estimated Total**: ~$20-30/month

### Cost Optimization
1. **Filter logs** to reduce ingestion costs
2. **Use metric filters** instead of custom metrics where possible
3. **Set appropriate retention periods**
4. **Archive old data** to S3
